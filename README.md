# **SECTION ONE** THIS Section:  Project Resources & Overview 

This MVP build phase will last 5 weeks with no more than 6 weeks maximum.

The App is now listed on  [Magic Store](https://magic.store/app/frontier-registry) with a scheduled release date of Sept. 15th


**The main goals are to**
1. Adapt Frontier Registry to Stellar Testnet using Soroban Smart Contracts
2. Integrate Freighter & XBull wallets - using plug-ins noted in the technical architecture
3. Automate a certification system so that the users can upload their research, publish it on chain
and receive a Certification document (NOTED In the Pitch Deck slide)
4. We need to have a function that shows the user what is processing, when.
5. We will deliver a working tool by the 5th week.
6. The next phase (Build Phase 2) will be AI integration for DATA PROVENANCE (AFTER these next 6 weeks)
